Knowledge base: a set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent
Entailment: a⊨b In every model in which a is true, b is also true

- Inference: process of deriving new sentences from old ones
Model checking: To determine if KB⊨α
> Enumerate all possible Modules
> If in every model KB is true, KB entails a, then KB⊨α
> Else it does not entails a
Knowledge engineering: encode idea to the computer
